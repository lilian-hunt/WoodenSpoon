# WoodenSpoon
The program that reads a file containing the match results of a tournament, and determines who (if anyone) is eligible for the wooden spoon. 
The file path should be the command line argument.

If a player has won the spoon, the program prints out the sequence of match results (in the order of R1, R2, R3, ..., QF, SF, F) that led to this determination.

An example file format is given in the folder.
